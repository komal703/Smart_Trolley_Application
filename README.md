🛒 #**Smart Trolley and Billing System**

An IoT-based smart shopping trolley system that automates supermarket billing using RFID technology, reducing checkout time and manual effort.

 📌 Project Overview

 The Smart Trolley and Billing System is designed to eliminate long queues at supermarket billing counters by enabling customers to scan products directly on the trolley using RFID technology.  
Each scanned product is added to a real-time billing system, allowing instant bill generation at checkout.
This project was developed as a **Bachelor of Engineering (Computer Engineering) final-year project.
